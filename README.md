# center_image_tag: Center your images with pure css

`center_image_tag` is another tag helper for Rails app which helps to center your image in its parent element view. It has the same arguments as `image_tag`, so you can easily integrate this into your current Rails app.

`center_image_tag` has a built-in fluid mode which would buy you some time to center the images in your responsive design. Otherwise, just set fixed width and height as in `image_tag`, you can also have images auto-centered with the set dimension.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'center_image_tag'


Then import `center_image_tag` in an SCSS file (for example, application.css.scss):

    @import 'center_image_tag';

## Options

`center_image_tag` has the same options as `image_tag` helper and adds 2 more options to the option hash:

  - `fluid`: set the image to be autoscaled with its parent. See 'Fluid mode' section below for details.
  - `container_class`: css classes to the outer container of center_image_tag. See 'Container class' section below for details.

## Modes of operation

`center_image_tag` has 2 modes of operation which are mutually exclusive, i.e. can't use at the same time, so try to pick up the best mode that fits your need.

### Fluid mode

`center_image_tag` can display the image which will auto scale with its parent element. The percentage between height and width of the image needs to be set:

```ruby
center_image_tag 'http://yoursite/image.png', fluid: '56.25%'
```

### Fixed width and height mode
`center_image_tag` can display the image whose width and height are fixed:

```ruby
center_image_tag 'http://yoursite/image.png', size: '200x100'
```

```ruby
center_image_tag 'http://yoursite/image.png', size: '100'
```

```ruby
center_image_tag 'http://yoursite/image.png', width: 200, height: 100
```

You can notice that these options are exactly the same as the `image_tag` helper.

## Container class
`center_image_tag` uses a nested `div` tags to make your image center. `container_class` option will help to add css classes to the outer container generated by `center_image_tag`, for example:

```ruby
center_image_tag 'http://yoursite/image.png', fluid: '56.25%', container_class: 'my-custom-class'
# => 
# <div class="... my-custom-class">
#   ...
#   <img src="http://yoursite/image.png" />
#   ...
# </div>
```

With this option, it can help in the case you need to add more styles or override the current styles of the generated container, e.g. make the image inline.

## Fallback
In the case that

  - `fluid' option is NOT set, AND
  - both width and height are NOT set (throught `size` option or `width`/`height` options)
  
`center_image_tag` will fall back to normal `image_tag`
